# To-Do List
A simple To-Do List application built using React and React Native that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. This app lets you create tasks, edit them, assign tags, delete tasks, and move tasks between different states such as "To-Do", "In Progress", and "Completed".

## Features
- Task Management: Add, edit, delete tasks
- Status Categories: Organize tasks into three main categories:
    - To-Do (Tasks that need to be done)
    - In Progress (Tasks that are currently being worked on)
    - Completed (Tasks that have been finished)
- Task Editing: Edit task titles
- Tagging: Assign different tags (e.g., Work, Personal, Family) to each task
- Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved to localStorage to persist between sessions
- Interactive UI: Simple and intuitive user interface with icons for task status changes.

## Technologies Used
